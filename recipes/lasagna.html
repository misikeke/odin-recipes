 <h4>A delicious lasagna</h4>
 <p>Must cook with heart</p>
 <p>Italian food</p>
 <h3>What you need to make it:</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>1 head red onion</li>
  <li>2 slice of garlic</li>
  <li>1kg grinded meat</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>pepper</li>
  <li>1l tomato sauce</li>
  <li>100g butter</li>
  <li>100g flour</li>
  <li>1l milk</li>
  <li>500g lasagna pasta</li>
  <li>100g cheese</li>
  <li>basil (if you like it)</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h3>Steps:</h3>

 <ol>
  <li>To prepare the lasagna recipe, sauté the finely chopped onion and garlic in a little oil, then add the ground meat and cook over high heat until the meat turns white.</li>
  <li>Season with salt and pepper. Then add a little water, cover, and simmer until tender. When it's nearly done, pour in the tomato sauce, season with basil, and let it cook together thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan, sprinkle in the flour, and heat it until it starts to turn pale. Gradually add lukewarm milk, season with salt, and cook into a moderately thick béchamel sauce. If it becomes too thick, you can thin it with a little more milk.</li>
  <li>Lightly oil a medium-sized baking dish. Spread a little meat sauce on the bottom, add more béchamel, then place a layer of lasagna noodles on top. Repeat the layers—meat sauce, béchamel, noodles—in that order. The key is to finish with a final layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle grated cheese on top, cover with aluminum foil, and bake in a preheated oven at 170°C (340°F) for about 35–40 minutes, until the pasta softens and the cheese turns golden brown.</li>
 </ol>
